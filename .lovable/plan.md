# 🖤 Pixel Link-in-Bio — Minimalist B&W

A clean, black-and-white link-in-bio page with subtle pixel art touches. Not corporate. Cool, personal, and to the point.

## Design
- **Pure black & white** color scheme with sharp pixel-inspired aesthetics
- **Pixelated avatar** or profile image area at the top (rendered with a CSS pixel border effect)
- **Monospace / pixel-style font** for headings; clean sans-serif for body
- **Subtle hover animations** — links shift, glitch, or pixelate on hover
- **Dithered or pixel-pattern dividers** between sections
- **Centered single-column layout**, mobile-first

## Page Structure
1. **Profile Section** — Pixelated avatar, your name/handle, one-line bio
2. **Link Buttons (3–5)** — Large, clean black-on-white (or inverted) buttons with pixel-style borders for your personal links, blog, socials, etc.
3. **Social Icons Row** — Small icon row at the bottom for Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, etc.
4. **Footer** — Tiny pixel art accent or signature

## Interactions
- Links have a satisfying pixel-shift hover effect (slight transform + border animation)
- Smooth fade-in on page load
- Cursor changes to a crosshair or custom pixel cursor for extra flavor

## Tech Notes
- Fully hardcoded — easy to update links by editing one config array
- No backend needed
- Single-page, super fast, fully responsive
